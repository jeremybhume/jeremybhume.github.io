<p>The following is a list of my available research works with shortened abstracts:</p>
<ul>

<li><i>Characterizations of zero singular ideal in étale groupoid C*-algebras via compressible maps</i>, <a href = " 	
https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07262">arXiv:2509.07262</a>. <p>Abstract: We characterize when the singular ideal in a non-Hausdorff étale groupoid C*-algebra is zero in terms of a geometric property of the isotropy groups and certain subgroups obtained from the groupoid. 
  This is achieved through the interplay between the Hausdorff cover and restriction maps on C*-algebras of groupoids to reductions by closed locally invariant subsets. We also prove a simpler algebraic characterization of zero singular ideal that holds 
  whenever the isotropy groups are direct limits of virtually torsion free solvable groups. </p>

<li><i>On Hausdorff covers for non-Hausdorff groupoids</i>, <a href = " 	
https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2503.23203">arxiv:2503.23203</a> (submitted). Joint with Kevin Aguyar Brix, <a href = "https://sites.google.com/view/julian-j-gonzales">Julian Gonzales</a> and Xin Li. <p>Abstract: We develop a new approach to non-Hausdorff étale groupoids using Hausdorff covers. 
As an application, we characterize in terms of a groupoid property when singular ideals vanish for Steinberg algebras and for C*-algebras of groupoids satisfying a finiteness condition.
Moreover, our approach reduces questions about simplicity, the ideal intersection property, nuclearity and amenability for groupoids to the Hausdorff case. </p>

<li><i>Minimal covers with continuity-preserving transfer operators for topological dynamical systems</i>, <a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11917">arxiv:2408.11917</a> (submitted). Joint with Kevin Aguyar Brix and Xin Li. <p>Abstract: To a non-invertible dynamical system we construct two covers of it by better behaved systems, generalizing the Krieger and Fischer covers of a sub-shift. We show these covers are functorial,
have universal properties and study the relationship between properties of the original system and properties of the cover, such as positive expansivity. </p>
</li>

<li><i>Katsura-Exel-Pardo self-similar actions, Putnam's binary factors and their limit spaces</i>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19863">arxiv:2405.19863</a> To appear in the Journal of the Australian Mathematical Society (special memorial issue for Iain Raeburn). Joint with Michael F. Whittaker <p>Abstract: We show that the dynamical system associated by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.14427">Putnam</a> to a pair of graph embeddings is conjugate to the shift on the limit space of a self-similar groupoid action defined by two matrices. We characterize the self-similar properties of these groupoids in terms of properties of the matrices. We prove their limit spaces are bundles of circles and points which fibre over a totally disconnected space and embed into the plane, answering a question posed by Putnam.</p>

<li><i>The K-theory of the C*-algebras associated to a rational function</i>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13420">arxiv:2307.13420</a> (submitted).<p>Abstract: We compute the K-theory of the three C*-algebras associated to a rational function, thought of as a dynamical system acting on its Julia set, Fatou set, or the entire Riemann sphere. Our results yield new dynamical invariants for rational functions and a C*-algebraic formulation of the Density of Hyperbolicity Conjecture for quadratic polynomials.</p>

<li><i>KK-duality for self-similar groupoid actions on graphs</i>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.03989">arxiv:2302.03989</a> Transactions of the American Mathematical Society, 377 (2024), 5513-5560. Joint with Nathan Brownlowe, Alcides Buss, Daniel Gonçalves, Aidan Sims, and Michael F. Whittaker
<p>Abstract: We prove that two naturally associated C*-algebras to a
regular and contracting self-similar groupoid are Spanier-Whitehead dual (in KK-theory) to each other by showing they are strongly Morita equivalent to the stable and unstable Ruelle C*-algebras of a Smale space arising from the self-similar limit space. </p>

<li><i>Renormalization procedures for C*-algebras</i> (MSc. Thesis at the University of Victoria), <a href="http://hdl.handle.net/1828/13285">(http://hdl.handle.net/1828/13285).</a> Supervised by Ian F. Putnam.
<p>Abstract: We introduce renormalization procedures for groupoids and C*-algebras, in analogy to renormalization procedures for families of dynamical systems. We prove a C*-analog to Masur’s unique ergodicity criterion for flat surfaces and apply this criterion to show a variety of C*-algebras have unique trace.</p>
