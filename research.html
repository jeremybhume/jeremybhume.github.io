<h1>Research</h1>
<p>The following is a list of my available research works with shortened abstracts:</p>
<ul>

<li><i>Katsura's self-similar groupoid actions, Putnam's binary factors, and their limit spaces</i>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19863">arxiv:2405.19863</a> (Invited submission to a special edition of the Journal of the Australian Mathematical Society in honour of Iain Raeburn). Joint with Michael F. Whittaker <p>Abstract: We show that the dynamical system associated by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.14427">Putnam</a> to a pair of graph embeddings is conjugate to the shift on the limit space of a self-similar groupoid action defined by two matrices. We characterize the self-similar properties of these groupoids in terms of properties of the matrices. We prove their limit spaces are bundles of circles and points which fibre over a totally disconnected space and embed into the plane, answering a question posed by Putnam.</p>
</li>

<li><i>The K-theory of the C*-algebras associated to a rational function</i>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13420">arxiv:2307.13420</a> (submitted).<p>Abstract: We compute the K-theory of the three C*-algebras associated to a rational function, thought of as a dynamical system acting on its Julia set, Fatou set, or the entire Riemann sphere. Our results yield new dynamical invariants for rational functions and a C*-algebraic formulation of the Density of Hyperbolicity Conjecture for quadratic polynomials.</p>
</li>

<li><i>KK-duality for self-similar groupoid actions on graphs</i>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.03989">arxiv:2302.03989</a> (accepted in Transactions of the American Mathematical Society). Joint with Nathan Brownlowe, Alcides Buss, Daniel Gonçalves, Aidan Sims, and Michael F. Whittaker
<p>Abstract: We prove that two naturally associated C*-algebras to a
regular and contracting self-similar groupoid are Spanier-Whitehead dual (in KK-theory) to each other by showing they are strongly Morita equivalent to the stable and unstable Ruelle C*-algebras of a Smale space arising from the self-similar limit space. </p>

<li><i>Renormalization procedures for C*-algebras</i> (MSc. Thesis at the University of Victoria), <a href="http://hdl.handle.net/1828/13285">(http://hdl.handle.net/1828/13285).</a> Supervised by Ian F. Putnam.
<p>Abstract: We introduce renormalization procedures for groupoids and C*-algebras, in analogy to renormalization procedures for families of dynamical systems. We prove a C*-analog to Masur’s unique ergodicity criterion for flat surfaces and apply this criterion to show a variety of C*-algebras have unique trace.</p>
