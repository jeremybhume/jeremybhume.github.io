<h3>Research Interests </h3>
<p> My interests are in dynamical systems, broadly interpreted to include topological groupoids, whose structure repeats at an infinite number of scales. I study the C*-algebra associated to such a dynamical system, which can be thought of as a "non-commutative" orbit space. The C*-algebra removes the pathologies present in the classical orbit space construction and allows for study of dynamical invariants, such as K-theory, which is another interest of mine.</p>
<h3>Current and Future Activities </h3>
<ul>
<li> I am organizing with colleagues the upcoming <a href="https://ymcstara.org/">YMC*A</a>, to be held in Glasgow from August 5th to 9th, in 2024. The conference is designed for early career researchers in the field of operator algebras to network amongst themselves and gain experience presenting their research. If you have any questions about the conference, please contact us at ymcstara2024 at glasgow dot ac dot uk. </li>
<li> I regularly attend the academic functions of the mathematical analysis group at the University of Glasgow, such as the weekly <a href="https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/mathematicsstatistics/events/?seriesID=5">analysis seminar</a> and <a href="https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/mathematicsstatistics/events/?seriesID=19"> working seminar</a>.</li>
<li> I will be presenting at the workshop "Noncommutative Geometry along the North Sea" (NSeaG) in Odense, held from August 19th to 23rd, 2024. </li>
