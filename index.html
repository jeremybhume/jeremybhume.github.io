<h3>Research Interests </h3>
<p> My interests are in dynamical systems, broadly interpreted to include topological groupoids, whose structure repeats at an infinite number of scales. I study the C*-algebra associated to such a dynamical system, which can be thought of as a "non-commutative" orbit space. The C*-algebra removes the pathologies present in the classical orbit space construction and allows for study of dynamical invariants, such as K-theory, which is another interest of mine.</p>
<h3>Current and Future Activities </h3>
<ul>
<li> I will be starting a one-year postdoctoral fellowship in January of 2025 at <a href="https://carleton.ca/math/">Carleton University</a>, under the supervision of <a href="https://people.math.carleton.ca/~cstar/">Charles Starling.</a><p> </p></li>
