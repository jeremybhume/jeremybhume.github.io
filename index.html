<h1>Jeremy B. Hume</h1>
<p> PhD student in Mathematics, <br>
<a href="https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/mathematicsstatistics/">University of Glasgow</a> (Supervisor: <a href="http://www.xinli.epizy.com">Xin Li</a>) </p>
<p>e-mail: jeremybhume at gmail dot com</p>
<p> Address: <br> Room 229<br>School of Mathematics and Statistics<br>University of Glasgow<br>University Place<br>Glasgow, G12 8QQ<br>United Kingdom </p>

<h3>Research Interests </h3>
<p> My interests are in dynamical systems, broadly interpreted to include topological groupoids, whose structure repeats at an infinite number of scales. I study the C*-algebra associated to such a dynamical system, which can be thought of as a "non-commutative" orbit space. The C*-algebra removes the pathologies present in the classical orbit space construction and allows for study of dynamical invariants, such as K-theory, which is another interest of mine.</p>
<h3>Current and Future Activities </h3>
<ul>
<li> On November 12th I will be speaking at the University of Oxford's <a href="https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/events/list/639">Functional Analysis Seminar.</a> <p> </p></li>
<li> On November 19th I will be speaking at Newcastle University's <a href="https://www.ncl.ac.uk/maths-physics/research/seminars/pure/">Analysis Seminar.</a> <p> </p></li>
<li> On November 26th I will be speaking at the University of Southern Denmark's <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/operator-algebras-sdu/home">Operator Algebras Seminar.</a><p> </p></li>
<li> I regularly attend the academic functions of the mathematical analysis group at the University of Glasgow, such as the weekly <a href="https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/mathematicsstatistics/events/?seriesID=5">analysis seminar</a> and <a href="https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/mathematicsstatistics/events/?seriesID=19"> working seminar</a>. </li>
