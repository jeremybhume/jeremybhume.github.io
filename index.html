<h3>Research Interests </h3>
<p> My interests are in dynamical systems, broadly interpreted to include topological groupoids, whose structure repeats at an infinite number of scales. I study the C*-algebra associated to such a dynamical system, which can be thought of as a "non-commutative" orbit space. The C*-algebra removes the pathologies present in the classical orbit space construction and allows for study of dynamical invariants, such as K-theory, which is another interest of mine.</p>
<h3>Current and Future Activities </h3>
<ul>
<li> I will be speaking at the workshop <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/odenseag2024/home">"Noncommutative Geometry along the North Sea"</a> (OdenSeaG) in Odense, held from August 19th to 23rd, 2024. <p> </p> </li>
<li> I will be speaking at the <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/operatoralgebrasinthesouth">"Operator Algebras in the South of the UK"</a> meeting in Southampton, held from September 6th to 7th, 2024.  <p> </p> <li>
<li> I regularly attend the academic functions of the mathematical analysis group at the University of Glasgow, such as the weekly <a href="https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/mathematicsstatistics/events/?seriesID=5">analysis seminar</a> and <a href="https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/mathematicsstatistics/events/?seriesID=19"> working seminar</a>. </li>
